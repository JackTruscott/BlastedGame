Personal log 04/06/2034
The Earth below is shrouded in a chaotic storm of fire and smoke. Satellite communications went down 4 days ago, and with it, our contact with Earth’s space agencies - Houston, Moscow, Beijing - all gone. The silence is deafening. I've been monitoring frequencies all night using the ham radio, desperate for any sign of life. Then - finally - amidst the static, I heard a faint voice. It was scrambled at first, but I caught the call sign: 'Kilo Foxtrot 3-9-8'. Homesteaders, likely still operating their makeshift stations in the midst of the devastation. I immediately responded, using our station callsign:(TRANSCRIPT BELOW)
ISS: NA1SS to Kilo Foxtrot 3 - 9 - 8, do you copy ? This is NA1SS, we are still in orbit.
 //The transmission was broken, filled with bursts of interference, but I could make out their reply.
KF398: NA1SS, we hear you! We're here. Holding. How's the sky?
 //I don't know how long their survival will last, but for now, they remain. It's our last connection to the world below.
