We've started the slow process of decommissioning the ISS today, following the usual protocols. The station is old - 36 years in orbit and barely holding together. It's routine. Powering down the science labs, clearing out the old research equipment, shutting off communication relays. The systems are dated, some on their last legs, but we've kept them operational longer than anyone thought possible. Now, it's just about making sure everything is safely powered off, secured, and ready for the eventual re-entry. The Earth below is as stunning as ever, rotating peacefully in the distance. There's talk of rising tensions among the major powers back home, but we have our work cut out for us. The last thing we expect is for the decommissioning to be anything but routine.
