Personal log 04/03/2034
The station hums around us, but the stillness has settled into something far worse than quiet. It's as if the world below has stopped entirely. I check the comms again, trying to re-establish contact with Houston, but there's no response. And then—just as we begin to focus on what to do next - a bright flash erupts on the surface of the Earth. At first, it looks like a distant thunderstorm, but it's too intense, too sudden. I freeze. The flash is followed by another, then another. Cities are lighting up all over, dotting the ground like some kind of messed up firework show in the night. Only this isn't a celebration. It's something much worse. I don’t know what's happening down there, but the flashes seem too consistent, too deliberate.
