Personal log 04/05/2034
I'm working on the backup communication systems now. It's a long shot, given all the smoke, but maybe we can get a signal through. I've gone through the manual twice already, checking every connection, every wire, every protocol, but nothing seems to work. It's like the system has been completely fried. It could well be, given that explosions of that magnitude put off an electromagnetic pulse. For all we know, our equipment could only think it works, while not getting a single signal through. Meanwhile, the flashes continue below, relentless. I can't look away. There's a sinking feeling in my chest as I watch the world I once knew being wiped out, piece by piece. The blasts are too bright, too frequent to be random. This isn’t just a war - it's something much larger, much worse than any conflict we've ever known. And we are stuck here, out of reach.
