Today's task was to power down the life support systems. It's a delicate process - closing down the oxygen generators and thermal regulation, making sure there are no leaks. The same checks we've done a thousand times. But as I reach for the switch, the comms crackle unexpectedly. At first, it's just static - fragments of voices breaking through the noise. We're used to occasional glitches, but this feels different. Then the transmission cuts out entirely. The static lingers longer than it should, and we sit in silence, waiting for any response. But there's nothing. We can still hear each other in the station, but no word from ground control. A strange sense of unease settles over us. We've been trained for emergencies, but this doesn't feel like one. Something is off.
