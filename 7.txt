This morning's transmission was more stable than last night's. I managed to make contact with KF398 again. The signal was weak, but there was clarity in their words. They spoke of rationing, keeping the small community together, and using the ham radio as their lifeline. They asked about the Earth, about the ISS, about what was left. (TRANSCRIPT BELOW)

KF398: NA1SS, what's left of the world down there? What's happening?
 //I took a deep breath before responding, knowing the truth would hurt. 
ISS: Kilo Foxtrot 3-9-8, the sky is dark with smoke. The cities, they've fallen. There's nothing left but ashes, and we can't see any lights until the smoke clears. But you're still there. You're holding.
 //There was a pause, long enough for me to worry if the signal had dropped again. Then their voice crackled through the static once more, tinged with both relief and sorrow: 
KF398: We're still here. We'll keep holding. You're our last link.
 //The isolation is overwhelming, but hearing their voices again, it keeps something alive inside us. As long as we're still in touch, there's a glimmer of hope. For now, at least, we keep the signal open.
