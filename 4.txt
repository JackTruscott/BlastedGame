Personal log 04/04/2034
The flashes continue all night, and the world below seems to be burning with them. I try again to get any kind of communication, but the system is dead. The radio waves are filled with nothing but static, likely due to the massive amounts of smoke and debris now visible from up here. We were supposed to have redundancy for issues like these, but it's as if we're disconnected entirely from Earth. My heart is racing as I watch the blinding light of explosions flicker across the planet's surface, lighting up entire regions in the blink of an eye. One of my colleagues suggests we send a distress signal, but without comms, that's impossible. We've been trained for these moments, but there's no protocol for a situation like this - where the world has erupted in flames, and we're floating in the silence of space, unable to reach anyone. The Earth we've known is slipping away. And we're still here, helpless.
